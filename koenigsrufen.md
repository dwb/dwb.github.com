# The Game of Königsrufen

## Introduction

Königsrufen is a trick-taking game for four players in which there is a permanent set of trumps. The contract played is determined by bidding, and in most contracts the object is not to win a certain number of tricks but to capture in the tricks cards amounting to a certain value.

The order of a game is as follows:

1. The deal
2. Bidding for game
3. Doubling and announcements (if allowed for the game that was bid)
4. Playing of tricks
5. Scoring

### The Cards

A 54-card Austrian Tarock pack is used. Packs of the same design are used in Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovenia under the very similar names "Tarokk" and "Tarok". A pack of the same composition is also known in Germany, but is called a "Cego" pack (for the game of the same name), and the pack called "Tarock" in Germany is unsuitable -- it has only 36 cards.

In Cheltenham, a Piatnik "Industrie und Glück" Tarock deck is standard.

A French pack of Tarot playing cards can be suitably shortened. The Swiss or Italian pack -- or even the soothsayers' tarot pack -- could be suitably shortened, but have south European suit-signs.

In the Austrian pack there are:

* Twenty-two trumps: the highest, called the Sküs (from the Ialian for "excuse"), is un-numbered, but the remainder are numbered from XXI (high) to I (low). Certain numbered trumps have names:
    * I: Pagat (from the Italian "bagatella", meaning "trifle" or "conjourer's trick")
    * II: Uhu (German for "eagle-owl", and is presumably a satirical reference to the Imperial Eagle on the card)
    * III: Kakadu (German for "cockatoo")
    * XXI: Mond (Italian for "world", and on Italian cards the world is indeed illustrated on this card. Also German for "moon", and so the moon is shown on modern Austrian cards)
* Four court cards and four pip cards each in hearts and diamonds, ranking King (high), Queen, Knight, Jack, 1, 2, 3, 4 (low).
* Four court cards and four pip cards each in clubs and spades, ranking King (high), Queen, Knight, Jack, 10, 9, 8, 7 (low).


## The Deal

One player - say the owner of the cards - deals one card at a time anti-clockwise (starting with the player to their right) until a king appears. The player with this king deals first.

The dealer shuffles and offers the pack to their left to be cut. If the player on the left does cut, then dealer places six cards face down in the centre of the table as the "talon" and then deals anti-clockwise in packets of six cards, starting with forehand (the player to the dealer's right). Six cards are then dealt to each player again to give twelve cards to each hand.

If, however, the player to the dealer's left raps the pack with their knuckles to signify that he does not wish to cut, then forehand chooses whether the dealer shall deal normally as above, or else deal six as the talon follwed by four packets of twelve. In this case, forehand, second, and third hands choose -- in this order -- which pile to pick up, with the dealer taking the last packet. The rapping is called "klopfing".

The talon can alternatively be dealt as a packet of six cards at any stage, or as packets of three cards at any two stages, provided the p1ayers' hands are dealt in packets of six cards (or twelve if that option was chosen after a klopf).

### When more than four players meet

* If five players meet, dealer sits out, but forehand is still on their immediate right
* If six meet, dealer and the person two to their right sits out.
* If seven meet, dealer and the people two and three to their right sit out, so that all pairs of players play together equally often.

The next game is normally dealt by the person to the right of the old dealer, but if extra players have joined or left the table than the next game is dealt so that the new forehand is to the right of the previous forehand.

## Bidding For Game 

Forehand opens the bidding with Rufer (which only forehand may bid), or any other contract apart from Trischaken or Sechserdreier.

Bidding then follows anti-clockwise around the table, ending with forehand again. Each player in turn must make a bid of a contract higher (that is, further down the table below) than the previous bid, or pass, forfeiting their chance to bid entirely. When all players have bid or passed, forehand must either pass, or make one final bid, which can be the same contract or higher than the highest bid thus far. The winner of the bidding is known as the declarer.

If a forehand bid of Rufer is passed around, forehand may switch to Trischaken (by immediately leading a card, skipping announcements and doubling and proceeding directly to the game) or Sechserdreier (by turning over all six cards of the talon).

## Calling a King

If declarer bid Rufer (and did not switch it to Trischaken or Sechserdreier as above), Besser Rufer, or Solo, they must now call a king by naming its suit. No-one reveals if they do or do not hold the called king. Declarer may, if they wish, call a king which they hold - in this case they do not play with a partner and the game is scored as such, but this situation is not revealed until the king is played. King Ultimo is also scored as normal in this case. If declarer holds exactly three kings, they may call "the other king" or "the fourth king".

## Exchange with the Talon

If declarer bid Rufer, Besser Rufer, or Dreier, they turn over the top three cards of the talon, followed by the bottom three - showing them to all players. They must choose which group of three cards to take into their hand - the remaining three go to the defenders to score as points, as if it was a won trick.

If the called king is found in the talon declarer may concede, automatically losing that hand and paying the points accordingly. This prevents anyone from doubling the game with a Kontra. If declarer decides to play on, they take one half of the talon as normal. A conceded Besser Rufer is deemed to have included announcing Pagat. Whether they concede or play alone, declarer collects from or pays to all three opponents.

If forehand turns over all six cards of the talon at once, to announce Sechserdreier, they take them all into their hand.

Declarer must then put down as many cards as they picked up to return their hand to twelve cards. The discarded cards will be scored as if they were a won trick. Kings, the Sküs, the Mond and Pagat must never be discarded. Other trumps can only be discarded if there are no alternatives, and they must be shown to the other players before discarding.

## Announcements and Doubling

Now the announcements and/or doublings start. In Bettel, Piccolo, Bettel Ouvert and Piccolo Ouvert, there are no announceable feats available to any player and so forehand must pass. In Sechserdreier, announceable feats are available to all players except forehand. Any feats that forehand makes (or fails at) in Sechserdreier are scored at the unannounced rate.

Otherwise, forehand starts by calling zero or more announcements or doublings (as in the table below), and then "pass" to signal they are not calling any more. Defenders (opponents of the declarer) must prefix any announcements they make with "defensive".

The game and any announced feats are scored separately - even in Besser Rufer - and so can be doubled separately by any successive opponent by announcing "kontra the [game or feat]". This doubles the amount of points the game or feat is worth - both to win or lose by. The declarer or announcer of the feat then has the option to re-kontra, quadroupling the points value. Finally, the opponent can then sub-kontra if they wish, briging the game or feat to eight times its normal value.

A defender announcing 45 or Valat must first kontra or subkontra the game, and if declarer or their partner announces 45 after a kontra then they must first re-contra.

It is legal for someone to bid Besser Rufer when they don't hold a bird, hoping they find one in the talon. If they don't, they still must announce one even though they cannot make it. Similarly, declarer can announce King Ultimo for their partner's king, hoping that they make it.

In Solo and Solodreier all announceable feats, including Valat, count double - whether announced or not.

Announcements and doubling finish when three players in succession have said nothing but "pass".

## Playing of Tricks

Forehand leads a card to the first trick, except in Bettel and Bettel Ouvert where declarer leads. Play continues anti-clockwise.

If a suit is led it must be followed if possible. If no card of the led suit is held, a trump must be played. If no trumps are held any other card can be played, but it cannot win the trick.

In negative contracts (see table), play is also subject to the "rising rule": if a player can legally play a card that beats those already played, they must do so.

If a player has announced Pagat, Uhu, Kakadu or King Ultimo, they must try to make the feat even if it is clear they cannot - the relevant card cannot be deliberately played early or late unless they have no other legal card to play. If there is a trick where one of many announced cards is forced, the player can choose which one to play.

If a suit is led and no trump is played the highest card in that suit wins the trick, otherwise the highest trump does. The winner of the trick leads the next. Tricks are kept face-down by their winner or a player known by the whole table to be on the same side.

## Scoring

In Rufer, Besser Rufer, Dreier, and Besser Dreier, the three cards discarded by declarer before play as part of the talon exchange are added to the declarer's pile of won tricks. In Sechserdreier, declarer takes the six cards discarded.

In Solo and Solodreier, the talon is given to the defending side unless Solo was played and the called king is found in it, in which case in Cheltenham, the whole talon is taken by the defender. In this case the declarer pays to or receives from all three defenders, but if they failed, any Kontra is cancelled unless it had been Re-Kontra'd or the declarer had made any announcements.

In Solo and Solodreier, if declarer (or partner, if any) announced 45 and Valat (announced or not) is made, the defence do not get the talon - so even in the unlikely event that the talon holds twenty-six points, the 45 is still made. Similarly, if in Solo the defence bid 45 and make Valat and the called king is in a twenty-six-point talon, then the 45 would be allowed.

To count points, for each set of three cards, or two odd cards at the end of the pile, count one point, plus:

* four more for each king, the Pagat, Mond, and Sküs
* three more for each queen
* two more for each knight
* and one more for each jack

The total is seventy, except in Trischaken where some cards are out of play in the talon.

It is thought this curious way of counting is borrowed from a three-handed game, in which the sets of three cards would be the tricks.
